          At Sea World, we believe in blending education with adventure through
          our development programs & camps. Our kid&apos;s summer camp programs offer
          a one-of-a-kind opportunity for youth to connect with the ocean, build
          outdoor skills, and enjoy learning outside the traditional classroom.
          Camper explore marine ecosystems, environmental conservation, and
          sustainability through fun, hands-on activities that turn every day
          into an exciting adventure.

          In addition to our summer camps, Sea Smart offer&apos;s a variety of
          enriching school programs designed to complement British Columbia&apos;s
          curriculum. From science-based workshops to outdoor beach excursions
          and project-based learning, our programs inspire students to develop a
          lifelong love for the environment. We foster creativity, teamwork, and
          critical thinking in learners of all ages.
